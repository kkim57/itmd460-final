      <p>Gerbils are small rodents commonly kept as pets. Although many people, pet stores, and pet product manufactuerers consider them to be interchangeable with hamsters, this is far from the truth! Gerbils are unique animals and require different approaches and cares when compared to hamsters. If you're here, you wish to learn about what this means in terms of habitat: what is the best housing for your furry little friends?</p>
        <p>Unlike hamsters, gerbils are social animals that are best kept in even numbers. Two, four, and so on.
