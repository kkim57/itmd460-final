      <p>A CritterTrail is a type of cage that is made mainly out of colorful plastic with a few metal bars. CritterTrails come with many parts such as tubes and fancy wheels that all connect together to create sprawling mazes of homes.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul><li>Colorful. CritterTrails come in bold, eyecatching colors.</li>
    <li>They look "cool." If CritterTrails do one thing, it's look impressive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul><li>Small. CritterTrails are extremely tiny. The companies that make these types of cages want you to buy more than one and use their tubes to connect them together.</li>
    <li>Hard to clean. With such cramped sizes and lots of little tubes, CritterTrails are a nightmare to clean. You will need to take each part off, clean it, and put it back on.</li>
    <li>Bad air flow. Because most of a CritterTrail home is solid plastic with only tiny portions of metal bars, not a lot of air will be flowing in or out of the cage. The result is a hot, miserable, and stinky cage which is fun for neither gerbil nor human.</li>
    <li>Because they are made mostly of plastic, CritterTrails are dangerous to gerbils, who try to chew up everything they can get into their mouths.</li>
    <li>Being plastic containers with flimsy, cage like doors, CritterTrails have a high escape risk.</li>
    <li>Expensive! CritterTrails are the most pricey option out there and offer you the least. The companies that make them want you to buy lots of accessories and extensions, even multiple cages that need to be connected together!</li>
    <li>They take up a lot of space. Even though they are small, CritterTrails are meant to be connected together and also come with very bulky extensions and attachments that take up a lot of space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>CritterTrails are the worst option not just for gerbils, but also for hamsters, mice, rats, and just about anything else. They are expensive and offer you less than any of the other possible options. Save money and keep your gerbil friends happy by avoiding CritterTrails!</p>
<p>If you still need convincing, check out the video below. It is of a hamster, but the everything in it applies to gerbils as well. Notice how small the cage is compared to the size of the hamster and how easily the hamster was able to push the door open.</p>
