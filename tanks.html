      <p>Tanks refer to large glass containers that are open on the top. Typically, this means fish tanks meant for holding fish or reptile terrariums. When buying a tank, a screen cover of some kind is needed to keep your gerbils in and any potential dangers out. An alternative to a screen is a <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Ware-Manufacturing-Chew-Proof-Small/dp/B0027J381U/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1513148644&sr=8-2&keywords=tank+topper&sa-no-redirect=1>tank topper</a>, which can provide extra space for gerbils, but is not necessary and will make cleaning more difficult and time consuming. For a pair of gerbils, 20 gallons is the minimum size, but bigger is always better!</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul><li>Well priced. In terms of size to price, glass tanks provide some of the best space for money. They can be even cheaper if someone in your neighborhood is looking to get rid of an old fish tank. Cracks can easily be repaired for cheap.</li>
    <li>Glass sides makes it easy to watch your gerbils explore and play.</li>
    <li>Solid high walls are able to hold the required amount of digging space and more.</li>
    <li>With a screen or a topper, there is almost no chance of escape.</li>
    <li>Provides good protection from other pets in the home such as dogs and cats.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul><li>Glass tanks can be heavy: ask a parent or older sibling to help if you need to move or carry it.</li>
    <li>Once used for gerbils, a glass fish tank can no longer be used for fish as it's likely the gerbils will have chewed on the waterpoof sealant.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Tanks are by far the best option for a gerbil home in the United States. Their advantages are numerous and the drawbacks are few. If the tank is large enough, your gerbils will be as happy as can be!
