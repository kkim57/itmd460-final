      <p>The most common type of small animal home, cages are made with metal bars and typically feature a pan to hold litter. Some cages have multiple levels allowing for vertical space.</p>
</center>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul><li>Easy to clean. Cleaning a cage typically means just dumping the dirty litter from the pan into the garbage and putting in fresh litter.</li>
    <li>Cages hold accessories well. Many toys and exercise wheels for small animals are designed to attach to cages which helps keep them in place and save space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul><li>A bit expensive. Cages tend to be more expensive than other options like tanks or bins.</li>
    <li>Not enough digging space. Gerbils require at least five inches, preferably more, of litter to dig into. Most cages don't come with deep enough litter pans to support this.</li>
    <li>Bar biting. Some gerbils take to biting on the bars of cages, which can get very annoying very quickly.</li>
    <li>Some cheaper cages come with plastic pans instead of metal ones. Plastic is both dangerous to gerbils and poses an escape risk.</li>
    <li>Speaking of escape risks, cage doors tend to not be secure. Flimsier ones can sometimes be pushed open by a determined enough gerbil or a sibling can accidentally leave it open. If you have a cage door, use a lock to secure it.</li>
    <li>Bars mean young children can poke their fingers through and get bitten or other pets may try to harm your gerbils through them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<center>
    <p>While cages make decent homes for hamsters, the same can't be true for gerbils. If you can afford to get a cage, you should get a tank with a screen instead for about the same price. Your gerbils will be much happier and safer.</p>
